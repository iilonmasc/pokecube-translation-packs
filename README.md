# pokecube-translation-packs

Are you using any of the pokecube mods for minecraft?

Are you used to the german/french/italian/spanish monster names but playing minecraft in english because you are used to the item/block names?

Well then this pack/repository is for you!

This pack is a translation resource pack for the pokecube mod to translate (most) mobs and moves to your language while still playing minecraft in english.

## Which pack to choose?

Packs are built for specific versions of pokecube, you can find your pack by taking a look at the name of the zip file.

E.g. a german pack built for pokecube 3.7.0 would look like this `pokecube-translation-de-3.7.0-2020-01-11.zip`
